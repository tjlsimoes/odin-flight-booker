# Flight Booker

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The idea is to create a one-way flight booker using Ruby on Rails. More specifically, the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:
1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of available flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers

It also features:
1. A dynamic booking page using Stimulus (Javascript) enabling the addition or removal of passenger fields.
2. Confirmation emails to passenger emails upon completion of the booking process.
